## Installation

(Tested on macOS 12.6, Ubuntu 16.04)

1) `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OllieBoyne/FIND`
2) Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) and [PyTorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
3) `pip install -r requirements_<mac_linux/windows>.txt`
4) Download the [Foot3D](https://github.com/OllieBoyne/Foot3D) dataset
5) [Download the models](#model-downloads)
6) Edit `src/cfg.yaml` with dataset locations

## Usage

### Training models (3D)

Training parameters are defined in a `.yaml` file in the `cfgs` directory. `train_3d.yaml` is there as an example, which trains a FIND model, as well as a baseline [SUPR](https://github.com/ahmedosman/SUPR) model for comparison. To run this training:

```
python src/train/run_expmt.py --exp_name train_3d
```

### Evaluating models (3D)

Models are evaluated for 3D metrics (chamfer and keypoint error) under the `exp` folder, which they will be saved to after training. An entire directory of models within `exp` is evaluated at once, for example:

```
python src/eval/eval_3d.py --exp_name 3D_only
```

Evaluation outputs are saved to `eval_export/eval_3d`

## Model downloads

- Pre-trained FIND models can be [downloaded from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13C8xftuvJTicMCsdyg-B8ZgmU_CA07iv?usp=sharing)
- To compare against [SUPR](https://github.com/ahmedosman/SUPR), please download their left_foot .npy files from their website to `src/model/SUPR/models`
